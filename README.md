My personal blog, designed to originally overcome the restrictions of WordPress and as an introduction for myself into fullstack development.

Has several core features, including:
* a intuitive admin interface
* simple blog postings with the option for a unique photo column
* built to run on a single server
* multi-user support
* first and foremost a website, with blog features added, not vice-versa
